# Module # SQL Task

## Attention!!!

We use the H2 database to test the tasks, so pay attention to the query syntax if the test fails, and if it works in
your
database. All queries must be written on one line and end with semicolon.

        - id bigint(Primary key)

        - name varchar

        - description varchar

        - grade int

    3. PaymentType:

        - id bigint(Primary key)

        - name varchar

    4. Payment:

        - id bigint(Primary key)

        - type_id bigint(FOREIGN KEY to PaymentType)

        - amount decimal

        - student_id bigint(FOREIGN KEY to Student)

        - payment_date datetime

    5. Mark

        - id bigint(Primary key)

        - student_id bigint(FOREIGN KEY to Student)

        - subject_id bigint(FOREIGN KEY to Subject)

        - mark int
